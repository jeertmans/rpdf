*rpdf makes working with PDF annotions super easy! It can `merge` annotations from multiple files,
some show statistics (`stats`) or `strip` specific (or all) annotations.*

## About

rpdf is a Rust binary that aims to provides an open source and straighforward command-line alternative to other
tools such as [PDF Annotator](https://www.pdfannotator.com/en/help/filescombine) and others.

*Disclaimer: rpdf is currently in an early stage, and does not implement many features.
I was first developed for my own use, because I needed to merge annotations from PDFs I review with other people.
Do not hesitate to propose new features if you feel they could be intersting!*

## Installation

You can install the latest version with `cargo`.

```bash
> cargo install rpdf
```

## CLI Reference

The command line tool is pretty straighforward to use and is self-documented:

Anytime you need help for a command, you can use `rpdf <COMMAND> --help`, or `-h` for the short version.

### Examples

#### Annotations statistics

You can count how many annotations your file contains:

And you can also do this per page:

#### Merge annotations

Say we have to files with the same content but different annotations:

You can merge the annotations from both files into one with the `merge` command,
and verify that all the annotations are present in the final product:

#### Strip annotations

If you want to remove some annotations from a PDF, you can do so with the `strip` command:

![strip](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27275099/235351437-5846c8bf-cd1c-4f27-9f3a-04257251251b.png)

By default, `strip` excludes `Link` annotations from the removal process.
You can modifiy the behavior with the `-e/--exclude` parameter.
